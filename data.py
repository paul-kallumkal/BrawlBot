He hunted the Fangwild Forest and its neighboring lands, and everything he met was prey or plunder. \nThe first years after Ember\u2019s disappearance from the Fangwild were good for the dragons. Without its heart, the eldritch forest descended into chaos, opening paths to new lands to ravage. Ragnir\u2019s favorite entrance to a new land was to emerge from an erupting volcano silhouetted against gouts of lava. In fire and battle, Ragnir\u2019s hoard grew. He collected mountain hearts from unlucky dwarf kings. He wrested so much gold from the Madman of Barbados that he is the pirate's Moby Dick.  His Fangwild lair grew so vast it was mistaken for a city of gold.\nBut now under mysterious assault, the forest is knotting itself into pure madness, and disaster looms. Ragnir knows the Fangwild\u2019s only hope is to restore its Heart, and he journeyed to Asgard to bring Ember back. To that end he takes humanoid form and fights in the Tournament, reveling in the battle. At night he reverts to dragon form, soaring over Asgard to find the path back to the Fangwild or just eat Odin's sheep.",

While Mary had a relatively normal childhood, her parents sometimes wondered why she would stare silently into the night sky for hours or read stories of the goddess Artemis killing the hunter Orion over and over again. \nMary was too eager to confront her opponent. At the first sign of her powers manifesting, she opened a wormhole intending to stride into Valhalla. Instead, she emerged in the vacuum of space.

Thus the might of the Strazci went undiminished.\nOver centuries, the Strazci won countless battles for their masters, but constant war whittled away the undead company's numbers. The power of the remaining Strazci concentrated and grew. Finally, at the great Siege of Lions, the final knights fell but one. Only Magyar, the last of the Strazci, survived the losing battle.\nMagyar remained to haunt the ruined halls of the abandoned castle until the 21st century finally brought doom. Grown complacent from dispatching meddling intruders armed only with snacks, Magyar was not ready when real monster hunters came armed with ethervision goggles, guns, and The Spear of Saint Cuthred.\nIn Valhalla, the spirits inside Magyar love battle, steer clear of Nix, and fill out the baritone section of the Asgardian Halloween Spooktacular Choir.",

    "bio_text":"With four pearl-handled lazblasters and his robot companion Orbot, Reno traveled the Rexxar star system hunting down the most vicious outlaws in the tri-stars. Four arms, compound eyes, and utter fearlessness make Chitinoids natural gunslingers, but Reno added a dose of genius that made him the greatest tracker this side of the Pecosid asteroid belt.\nReno never talked about his past. Some said he'd been raised by the wild Ocarians in the Endless Wastes. Some said he'd been a commander in the Zhaktar Wars. But everyone knew it wasn't smart to cross the laconic gunslinger if you valued your carapace.\nHe brought in the Gygan millipede in 500 tiny handcuffs. He collared the ninety-foot Death Worm, wanted for not returning library books. He stayed busy, often scheduling shootouts for high noon, 12:15, 12:30, and 12:45, then after lunch starting at 2:00.\nBut even for the best space bug cowboys, bounty hunting isn't much of a living, and it always ends on the wrong end of a laser. In Valhalla, Reno pretty much keeps to himself, though Orbot has become quite social, hanging out with Cassidy and even fighting for Thor when his Thunder Ball was in the shop. Reno fights for prize money and dreams of maybe winning enough to stake himself a little ranch on the Ifing river.",
