# BrawlBot

Brawlbot is a fun project I started to automate role distribution in my discord server, since the criteria that decides the role (ELO ranking) changes frequently.

Please provide all the permissions requested while adding the bot or it may not function correctly  

## Prefix : ?   
Use this before calling any command (example: ?help)  

## Currently supported command List:  
commands   
help  
setid  
rank (stats can also be used)  
autoset  

The bot is hosted on replit (https://replit.com/@PaulKallumkal/BrawlBot)  
Uptimebot is used to keep it active 24/7 (https://uptimerobot.com/)  

A special thanks to Brawlhalla developers for supporting this project by providing an API key which Brawlbot uses to fetch information
