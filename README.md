# BrawlBot

Brawlbot is a fun project I started to automate role distribution in my discord server, since the criteria that decides the role (ELO ranking) changes frequently.

Please provide all the permissions requested while adding the bot or it may not function correctly

To keep it active 24/7 the bot relies on [uptimerobot.com](https://uptimerobot.com/)  

A special thanks to Brawlhalla developers for supporting this project by providing an API key which Brawlbot uses to fetch information
