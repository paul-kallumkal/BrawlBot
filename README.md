# BrawlBot

Brawlbot is a fun project I started to automate role distribution in my discord server, since the criteria that decides the role (ELO ranking) changes frequently.

Please provide all the permissions requested while adding the bot or it may not function correctly  

BrawlBot can be found at [addbrawlbot.ml](http://addbrawlbot.ml)
